# Veridion Tech Challenge No.5 â†’ POC Simulation â†’ Data Flow

# ðŸ§¾ The Challenge

A large manufacturing companyâ€™s Procurement department is kicking off a digitalization journey. Their category managers have hit a wall â€“ they canâ€™t properly analyze spend because their supplier database is cluttered with messy, duplicate, and outdated entries. Meanwhile, leadership is pushing hard for a clear cost-saving strategy for next year. On top of that, thereâ€™s interest in exploring sustainability in the supply chain, but they just donâ€™t have the resources to prioritize it right now.

Theyâ€™re currently piloting solutions with two competitors: a well-known legacy provider and a newcomer. While theyâ€™re fairly satisfied with the newcomerâ€™s performance, the legacy playerâ€™s strong market reputation and proven value still carry weight. Budget is already allocated, and theyâ€™re set to make a decision next quarter.

### 1. Entity Resolution

Youâ€™ve received a sample of companies from the client for the POC. Each entry has been processed through our entity resolution engine, returning up to 5 candidate matches per row. Your task is to select the best match for each input. If none are accurate, you can leave it unmatched or find the correct entity elsewhere. The goal is to resolve every row to a real-world companyâ€”if it exists online, you should be able to find it.

### 2. Data analysis and QC

Once youâ€™ve picked the correct matches, review the data attributes we provide and look for any inconsistencies. You donâ€™t need to fix them (though youâ€™re free to if you want ðŸ˜„), but you should think through how to curate the dataset so itâ€™s clean and ready for the client.

### 3. Summarize your work

Walk us through everything you did and observed during the project. We care more about understanding your thinking process than the specific tools you used to get there.

### 4. Publish your work

Choose the format that you think best fits this type of challenge / use case and publish it. While solutions to all other challenges are expected to be published on github,  you can use the github field in the form below to link your work, even if it leads to a different domain other than github.
